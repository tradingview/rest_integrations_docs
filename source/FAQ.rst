FAQ
===

Authentication
--------------

What about error handling when an error occurs? Should we respond with error code 400 (Bad Request) or 200 (OK)?
   In response to an error, return the code 200. Send the error message to the ``errmsg`` parameter.

Are there any restrictions on the lifetime of tokens? What is the optimal lifetime?
   Max lifetime is a 32-bit signed integer ‚Äî-- ``2147483647``. It‚Äôs about 24.8 of a day. Furthermore, you can make it
   never-ending if you don‚Äôt send ``expired_in`` parameter, but we think this is unsafe.
   The token lifetime should not exceed ``20`` minutes for the optimal functioning.

There is no ``prompt`` parameter in the OAuth specification? How is it used?
   This parameter is a flag for prompting for user credentials. Everything should be simple on your side.
   * When you receive ``prompt: login`` in the authorization request, ask the user for credentials.
   * If successful, redirect the user (with an access token) to our ``redirect url``.
   * If you receive a request for authorization with ``prompt: none``, then immediately redirect with the token.

Will the ``scope`` parameter be sent on authorization? What about its values? How do we deal with them?
   You will receive a ``scope`` in the request upon authorization, but not when refreshing a token.
   This parameter is optional. We don‚Äôt process it on our side.

Do we have to implement all 4 types of authorization system?
   Integration is divided into 2 parts: data integration and trading integration. Data Integration supports
   `PasswordBearer`_, `ServerOAuth2Bearer`_ authorization types. Integration of the trading part supports 
   `PasswordBearer`_, `OAuth2Bearer`_ (Implicit Flow), `OAuth2Bearer`_ (Code Flow) authorization types.
   The types of authorization for each part of the integration (data and trading) may differ.

Is the data integration API being requested by the user`s browser or by TradingView server?
   Data integration API is requested only by TradingView servers. Authorization funtion is optional.
   You can either implement this or skip it.

Can you talk more about the flow of `PasswordBearer`_?
   In general, the flow is the following:

   1. The user selects a broker in the Trading Panel at the TradingView website.
   2. A popup for entering broker credentials is opened for the user.
   3. The user enters broker\'s credentials and presses the ‚ÄúConnect‚Äù button (submits the form).
   4. Your REST server receives a POST request to `/authorize`_ endpoint with credentials in it.
   5. Your REST server validates the credentials and, if successful, gives a response with a token.
   6. Then you get this token in all other requests to your REST server in the ``Authorization`` header.

Can we use the same Client ID in both staging and production environments?
   The –°liend IDs for each of the 6 environments connections must be unique, this is a requirement of our security team.
   The TradingView website in the sandbox or production can be connected to only 1 brokerage environment at a time. 

Are you able to support the OAuth2 Client Credentials Grant for authorizing to our server? 
   Our client uses OAuth 2.0 JWT Bearer Flow. Please check out `ServerOAuth2Bearer`_ section in our specs. We need
   X.509 cert to sign the JWT. Our client forms the JWT, signs it and sends it in the body of the POST request as
   assertion field and expects to get a token in response.

Authorization
-------------

.. Authorize
.. .........

.. Logout
.. ......

Should we implement `/authorize`_ and `/logout`_ endpoints for Implicit Flow?
   There is no need for an `/authorize`_ endpoint when using the `OAuth2Bearer`_ (Implicit Flow).
   Implementation of `/logout`_ is optional. Use it if you need to know when a user is logging out of his session.

Broker Configuration
--------------------

.. Configuration
.. .............

What about the ``locale`` parameter in Configuration, do we need to support all the languages?
   With this parameter we provide information about locale used by the user accessing the integration. You can use this
   information to create a more comfortable UX for a user.

How can I modify the tabs in the ‚ÄúPositions panel‚Äù?
   To get this done, you can use the ``positionCustomFields`` in the `/config`_ endpoint. If you want to use different
   custom columns for different accounts, use the ``positionCustomFields`` of the `/accounts`_ endpoint.

.. Mapping
.. .......

How can I map Forex symbols?
   You cannot map your Forex to any other exchange. The prices are different. If you want to support Forex, you need to
   connect your Forex data feed to TradingView using `/symbol_info`_, `/history`_, `/streaming`_ endpoints. You don\‚Äôt
   need to provide `/mapping`_ for Forex, so you don‚Äôt need to implement it in this case. `/mapping`_ is used for the
   exchange based instruments.

Account
-------

Can a user login multiple times simultaneously (login with the same account from two browsers for example)?
   That‚Äôs possible. Usually brokers limit number of concurrent session. For example, user can be connected from the
   desktop and mobile at the same time.

.. Accounts
.. ........

Where the user can see if his account is *live* or *demo*?
   The account type can be specified in the ``name`` parameter in the `/accounts`_ endpoint. A user can see this 
   information when selecting an account in the extra menu.

.. image:: ../images/accounts-menu.png
   :alt: Names in the account menu.
   :align: center

What happens if an account on the TradingView platform gets disabled/deleted on the broker side during trading session?
   If the account has expired and it happened while the broker session was connected, you should return error responses
   for that account. After 20 consecutive error responses, the user will be disconnected. After that, the user will try
   to login again, and the broker will send the list of active accounts.

   If it was the user‚Äôs only active account, you will send an error message in the ``errMsg`` to `/accounts`_. Login
   dialog will not occur and the user will be shown that message.

How to implement orders with brackets?
   :ref:`Brackets<section-concepts-brackets>` are Stop-Loss and Take-Profit orders. To place orders with brackets, set
   flags ``supportOrderBrackets``, ``supportMarketBrackets``, ``supportPositionBrackets`` to ``true``.
   
   After setting the ``supportOrderBrackets`` flag to ``true``, Stop-Loss and Take-Profit section will automatically
   appear in the :ref:`Order Ticket<section-uielements-orderticket>`. If you send brackets to `/orders`_ with the
   suitable ``type`` and ``status`` values, they will automatically appear in 
   :ref:`Positions<section-concepts-positions>`. The value of the ``parentId`` field must fit order's or position's id
   to which they are attached.

.. Instruments
.. ...........

Should we implement all the required fields (pipSize, pipValue, minTick) for all the instruments?
   These fields can have different values for the different brokers. We expect the broker's values in the 
   `/instruments`_ endpoint.

Should ``pipValue`` be returned in the `/instruments`_ in the instrument's currency or customer account currency?
   You should send it in the currency of the customer's account.

.. State
.. .....

We have two assets in trading account which is BTC and USDT. So for the `/state`_, what is the value of ``balance`` that we are supposed to return in this case?
   You can fully customize both the *Account Summary Row* and the *Account Summary Tab* and display the information you
   deem necessary there.

How often are quoted parameters (equity, margin level) recalculated?
   You provide this data (already calculated) in the `/state`_. The request interval is defined in the `/config`_ in the
   ``pullingInterval`` field.

.. Orders
.. ......

How to define the ``accountId`` for the oders?
   We get the ``accountId`` in the `/accounts`_ and then send your ``id`` of the account selected by the user (active)
   during the request.

üî•üéæ How can we map extra parameters required for order Placement in the order Custom fields. How can we map that in `/config`_ endpoint?
   This can be done via ``orderDialogCustomFields`` object at the account level (`/accounts`_ ‚Üí ``ui``) or at the
   instrument level (`/instruments`_ ‚Üí ``ui``), with the latter taking precedence.

.. Positions
.. .........

How does TradingView receive information about the events of the broker‚Äôs trading platform?
   We expect that all closed positions also will be sent to the `/positions`_ during the trading session.

   The same applies to executed orders. If we get an order with ``filled`` status in the /orders, then we show the user
   a message.

.. Balances
.. ........

.. Executions
.. ..........

.. Orders History
.. ..............

üî•üéæ What is the difference between *Filled*, *Cancelled* and *Rejected* in Orders tab and in History tab. Are these only available for a single login session in the Orders tab? Or should they always be the same as History? Wouldn't this be duplication of data in such case?
   The orders statuses can be divided into two groups in our API:
   
   * transitional (``placing``, ``inactive``, ``working``),
   * final (``rejected``, ``filled``, ``canceled``).
   
   The status of an order can only change from transitional to final, but not vice versa.
   
   Requests:
   
   * In response to the `/orders`_ request, we expect ALL orders of the current trading session and orders with
     transitional statuses from previous trading sessions.
   * In response to the `/ordersHistory`_ request, we expect ALL orders with final statuses from previous trading
     sessions.
   
   Tab Display:
   
   * The Orders tab displays all orders that come in response to the `/orders`_ request.
   * The History tab displays all orders that come in response to the `/ordersHistory`_ request and orders from
     `/orders`_ that have the final status. So, orders with final statuses from `/orders`_ are simultaneously displayed
     on both the Orders and the History tabs.

Market Data
-----------

.. Quotes
.. ......

Is the `/quotes`_ method required? Or do you have your own sources of quotes for securites?
   This method is optional, but highly required. It is needed to display your quotes directly in the 
   :ref:`Order Ticket<section-uielements-orderticket>`. This will reduce the chance of order execution at prices other
   than what the user sees.

Are requests for quotes coming from the client or from the server?
   Requests to the `/quotes`_ going from the client, requests to the `/streaming`_ going from the server. The broker
   should stream quotes to the `/streaming`_ for the server and simultaneously send them separately to each client in
   the response to the `/quotes`_ requests.

How we can provide values specific to the position side (buy or sell)?
   For example for EURUSD it is ``100000 * 0.00001`` or ``1.0``. This is in the currency of the symbol.
   Then we take this and multiply it with the selected quantity. That is the ``pipValue``.
   And then if we want it to be in the account currency, we need to know if it is a buy or sell position.

   So, you can provide any of these as ``pipValue`` and you can provide values specific to the position side in
   `/quotes`_.

Data Permissions
----------------

.. Groups
.. ......

What if a user may have a different set of instruments for different accounts, because there is no such parameter as account id in the `/permissions`?
   Different sets of instruments for different accounts can be implemented via `/instruments`_. The permission mechanism
   serves somewhat differently, for example, to restrict access to paid data.

Should we implement `/permissions`_ if we return the same set of instruments for all users?
   The `/permissions`_ endpoint specifies which groups are available for the certain user. It is only required if you
   use groups of symbols to restrict access to instrument‚Äôs data.

.. Permissions
.. ...........

We sell data subscriptions. How can we inform that real-time data is available to the user?
   A broker should implement the `/permissions`_ endpoint. Otherwise we will show :term:`BATS` data for these exchanges
   if the user didn‚Äôt buy a subscription from us.

   When user logs into the integration, we send requests to the `/permissions`_ for determing a list of the
   subscriptions. For users without real-time data subscriptions, we will show free BATS or delayed market data.
