   Order
      Instructions to a broker to purchase (buy order) or sell (sell order) assets on a trader's behalf. When an order 
      is placed, it follows a process of order execution.
   
   Position
      There are positions of two main types - the amount of assets which is owned (:term:`long position`), or the
      amount of debt (:term:`short position`). A trader takes a position when buys through a buy order, or if sells
      short assets.

   Long position
      A position gain when there is a price increase, and a position loss when there is a price decrease. It involves
      owning a security. A long position formed as a result of buying a symbol.

   Short position
      A position formed as a result of a short sale that hasn’t yet been covered. It profits when the security falls in
      price. A short often involves securities that are borrowed and then sold, to be bought back at a lower price,
      hopefully.

   :abbr:`DOM (Depth Of Market)`
      `Depth Of Market`_, known as Order Book, shows data streamed from the broker which supports Level 2 data.
      DOM shows the number of open buy and sell orders at different securities\' prices.
