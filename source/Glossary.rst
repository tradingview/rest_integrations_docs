      security. A long position formed as a result of buying a symbol.

   Short position
      A position formed as a result of a short sale that hasn't yet been covered. It profits when the security falls
      in price. A short often involves securities that are borrowed and then sold, to be bought back hopefully at a 
      lower price.
