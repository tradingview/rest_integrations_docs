Integration overview
========================

Integration architecture
------------------------

What are the parts of the integration
.....................................
The broker's integration consists of two independent parts: data integration based on a server-to-server 
architecture and trading integration based on a client-server architecture.

Why data integration is needed
..............................
The TradingView website can only receive data from the TradingView server. Indicators are counted on this server, as
well as server alerts, etc. In order for the market data to be first received by the TradingView server, and then
transferred to the client side, data integration is required.

In what cases it is possible not to integrate data
..................................................
Market data can come to the TradingView server from another source, for example, directly from the exchange. There is no
need for market data integration. In this case, broker implements `/mapping`_  endpoint to solve
:ref:`the symbol names matching<mapping-symbols-label>` issue between the TradingView and broker symbols.

How trading integration works
.............................
The trading integration uses a client-server architecture: requests from the user's browser are sent directly to the
broker's server. The TradingView server is not involved in this data exchange. An exception is a request to the
`/permissions`_. It is sent from the TradingView server to give the user access to the data.
  
Requests from the client browser require a configured :ref:`CORS policy<cors-policy-label>` on the broker side.

Trading integration issues
--------------------------

.. _section-trading-environments:

Types of environments
.....................

There are several environment variants used in the development and support of the integration. Each environment has its
URL.

- The *production environment* with the real market data is available to the end-users. TradingView implements the 
  production environment on its side, and the brokers do it on theirs.
- The *staging environment* is for testing and does not contain real market data. TradingView implements the staging 
  environment on its side, and the brokers do it on theirs.
- The *local environment* is used on developers\â€™ computers and does not contain real market data. Connections to the 
  brokerâ€™s staging environment are made from the ``localhost:6285`` address.

The table lists six pairs of environments connections.

+-------------------------+--------------------+
| TradingView environment | Broker environment |
+=========================+====================+
| production              | production         |
+-------------------------+--------------------+
| staging                 | production         |
+-------------------------+--------------------+
| localhost               | production         |
+-------------------------+--------------------+
| production              | staging            |
+-------------------------+--------------------+
| staging                 | staging            |
+-------------------------+--------------------+
| localhost               | staging            |
+-------------------------+--------------------+

A TradingView website in a sandbox or production can only be connected to one broker environment at a time.
You can switch between environments through the browser console. Instructions can be provided after configuration 
by the TradingView team.

.. _cors-policy-label:

Sandbox
.......

What is the Sandbox
''''''''''''''''''''
The sandbox is a fully functional copy of the TradingView website located at `beta-rest.tradingview.com`_.
Access to the resource is provided by adding an IP address to the whitelist on the TradingView side.

When broker's integration can be placed in the Sandbox
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
There are two conditions to place a broker integration to the sandbox:

- passing conformational tests at `tradingview.com/rest-api-test`_
- availability of market data required for the integration to work on the TradingView staging server.

If the broker does not integrate market data but uses data obtained by TradingView from another source,
it is necessary to implement the `/mapping`_ endpoint.

Localization support
....................
Usually, the integration of a specific broker is aimed at an audience using their own national language.
However, English language support is required for all requests coming from the main locale of the 
TradingView application.

The user's locale can be determined through the ``locale`` query parameter, which is present in every request coming 
from the client to the broker's server.

CORS policy
...........
Test servers and website versions in different languages are located on ``*.tradingview.com`` subdomains. For example, 
the German version of the site is located at ``de.tradingview.com``. TradingView can send a request from any of these 
addresses.

Therefore, you must include an ``Access-Control-Allow-Origin`` response header with the specific subdomain that sent 
the request in each endpoint for each response code.

In addition, in the broker staging environment it is necessary to allow requests from the ``localhost:6285``.
This address is used on developers\' computers.

.. ðŸš§
Using HTTP
..........
Please avoid using HTTP instead HTTPS.
Our site through ``Content-Security-Policy`` is prohibited from accessing anything through the insecure HTTP protocol.
HSTS disallows access to anything over the insecure HTTP protocol. Moreover, HSTS is exposed for **730 days** and
applies to all subdomains. In order for us to be able to make an HTTP request to your staging even from our staging,
we will have to:

* Turn off HSTS in production.
* Wait for two years.

.. ðŸš§
Features of the implementation of some endpoints
................................................
Processed once at login: `/config`_, `/accounts`_, `/ordersHistory`_, `/permissions`_.

The rest of the requests are sent either on a regular basis or are the result of user actions. In the first case, their
freuency is set using :ref:`section-pulling-intervals` in the `/config`_. In the second case, in the `Trading`_ section.

In some cases, the listed endpoints may not be implemented.

* `/mapping`_ --- no necessary if you work exclusively on your own symbols.
* `/executions`_ --- can be disabled through the config, but in this case, transactions will not be displayed on the 
  "Chart".
* `/positions`_ --- can be disabled through the config, not used for Crypto Spot trading.
* `/balances`_ --- can be disabled, used for Crypto Spot only.
* `/depth`_ --- can be disabled if you are not going to support :term:`DOM` display.
* `/permissions`_, `/groups`_ --- it's set up on our side, if you are not going to restrict certain groups of users 
  access to certain data (for example, on geographically, or depending on the tariff plan), we will not activated it 
  on our side.

Adding features after the integration release
................................................
New features need to be added to the broker's staging environment and tested in the sandbox.
The feature gets into production only after successful testing by the TradingView testing team.

Data integration issues
-----------------------

Data requirements
.................
All the data which are shown on TradingView have to meet the following standards:

* Real-time data obtained from the API streaming endpoint must match the
  historical data, obtained from the `/history`_ API. The allowed count of mismatched
  bars (candles) must not exceed 5% for frequently traded symbols, otherwise the
  integration to TradingView is not possible.

* Historical data should look healthy. It must not contain unreasonable price gaps, holes in
  history for 1 min and D-resolution, incorrect prices.

Source for comparison during testing
....................................
We need a source which can be used to compare data received from your API. Chart would be
the best option. If data is not available for free access we need an account to use them.
