Groups
------

The `/groups`_ endpoint gets a list of possible symbol groups in the integration.
Groups are sets of symbols of the same type.

The `/groups`_ implementation is necessary in two cases:

- If you plan to add different types of instruments, for example, one group for Forex, another for Crypto, etc.
- If you plan to restrict users from accessing certain symbols depending on their location or subscription plan.

.. important::
  Plan your symbol grouping carefully.
  Groups cannot be deleted, you can only remove all symbols from them.

Usage details
...............

There are several usage details on groups that you need to consider:

- Each integration can contain no more than 10 symbol groups.
- Each symbol group can contain up to 10,000 symbols. 
- You cannot put the same symbol into two different groups.
- Any user can have access to any number of groups.

How to use
.............

Requests to the `/symbol_info`_ endpoint include the ``group`` parameter which represents a group name.
`/symbol_info`_ returns only those symbols that belong to the specified group.
This way, TradingView can get information about which group each symbol belongs to.

If you choose to split symbols into groups, requests to `/symbol_info`_ should always be handled with the ``group`` parameter.
If the ``group`` parameter isn't specified, you should return an error.

If you don't want to group symbols, your API should ignore all `/symbol_info`_ query parameters.
For example, your API should return the same symbols for both a request with ``"group": "example_group"`` (for any group) and a request without ``group``.

Examples
.........

An example of division into groups for the Crypto brokers:

.. code-block:: json

  {
    "s": "ok",
    "d": {
      "groups": [
        {
          "id": "broker_spots"
        },
        {
          "id": "broker_futures"
        },
        {
          "id": "broker_swaps"
        }
      ]
    }
  }

An example of division into groups for the Forex and CFD brokers:

.. code-block:: json

  {
    "s": "ok",
    "d": {
      "groups": [
        {
          "id": "broker_forex"
        },
        {
          "id": "broker_commodities"
        },
        {
          "id": "broker_cfd"
        },
        {
          "id": "broker_indices"
        }
      ]
    }
  }

Adding groups after release
............................

To add new symbol groups after release, implement the groups and add them into the staging environment.
After that, notify the TradingView team.

.. note:: 
  New group testing takes 1âˆ’2 weeks.

Access restrictions for users
..............................

If you plan to restrict access to some symbol groups, you also need to implement the `/permissions`_ endpoint.
It gets the list of groups available for a particular user.
So, when a TradingView user logs into their broker account, they will have access to one or more groups, depending on the list returned in `/permissions`_.
