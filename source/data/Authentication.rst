ðŸŽ¾ Authentication
-----------------

If your integration imply brokerage data stream and your data is public, you might not implement the authorization 
endpoint. For the `/authorize`_ endpoint, you should use either :ref:`PasswordBearer <password-bearer-flow>` or 
`ServerOAuth2Bearer`_.

You should have two separate sets of credentials for your production server. So, for OAuth2, these are different *client 
id*, *client secret* and *private key*. Each request to `/authorize`_ must return a unique token with a limited 
lifetime. Several clients must be able to log in with one set of credentials. 

If `/authorize`_ is exitst, all requests without a token or with an expired token should return code ``401``.
