Introduction
============

This API lets brokers build a bridge to connect their backend systems to the TradingView interface. The brokers 
then can be supported on the `TradingView Web Platform`_ and/or license the `Trading Platform`_. The same bridge is 
used to enable both services, but each is licensed separately â€” so whether you go with one or both is up to you.

The integration is very simple. The broker builds a `REST Web API`_ on its own servers based on our specification so 
that it can be connected to TradingView. TradingView provides a sandbox and required technical assistance to get 
your TradingView Web Platform integration started.
