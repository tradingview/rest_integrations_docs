Introduction
============

This API lets brokers build a bridge to connect their backend systems to the TradingView interface, so that broker
partners then can be supported on the `TradingView Web Platform`_.

The integration is very straightforward. The broker builds a `REST Web API`_ on its own servers based on our
specification so that it can be connected to TradingView. TradingView provides a sandbox and required technical
assistance to get your TradingView Web Platform integration started.
