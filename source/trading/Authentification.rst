Authentication
--------------

.. contents:: :local:
   :depth: 2

After passing the authentication, regardless of the method of obtaining the access token, all requests to the 
broker's REST server will be signed using the ``Authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN`` header.

Password Bearer
...............
In this type of authorization, the user enters the login and password on the TradingView website.
The broker's server receives the entered user credentials in a POST request to the `/authorize`_ endpoint.

Fields expected in response:

* ``access_token`` --- access token, which will be used to sign requests to the broker's REST server.
* ``expiration`` --- token expiration time in Unix Timestamp format, optional parameter.

In the current implementation, the token will not be refreshed, even if the ``expiration`` field is received in the 
response and that point in time is approaching. This is due to TradingView's security policy, which prohibits the 
storage of any user credentials from third-party resources on the TradingView side.

By default, placeholders in the authorization pop-up window have the values ``login`` and ``password``.
If you wish to change these values, provide your version in English.

OAuth2Bearer
............
TradingView's security policy does not allow the same OAuth secrets for all of the six supported
:ref:`connections<environments-label>` between the TradingView client and the broker's server. Therefore, all
``client_id`` values (and ``client_secret`` values in case of using the :ref:`OAuth2 Code flow<oauth2-code-flow>`
authorization option) must be unique. On the TradingView side, all OAuth secrets are kept in a special high-security 
secret vault. Security audits are performed regularly.

.. important:: The token is refreshed asynchronously and takes some time. Therefore, the broker's server must accept 
  requests with the old access token until requests come with the new token. After that, the old token can be invalidated.

OAuth2 Implicit flow
''''''''''''''''''''
This type of authorization is implemented following :rfc:`6749#section-4.2`. 
Let's consider :ref:`authorization<oauth2-implicit-flow-authorization>` and 
:ref:`token refresh<oauth2-implicit-flow-refresh-token>` procedures.

.. _oauth2-implicit-flow-authorization:

Authorization
"""""""""""""
#. A user opens the "Chart" page on the TradingView website. Then he selects a broker in the "Trading Panel".
#. A login popup appears. The user clicks the "Continue" button on this popup.
#. A new browser tab opens at the broker's *Authorization URL*.
#. The following parameters are sent in the GET request:

    * ``response_type`` --- the value will always be ``token``.
    * ``client_id`` --- unique identifier of the client.
    * ``redirect_uri`` --- `Redirection Endpoint`_. For security reasons, it is better to configure the value of 
      this parameter on your server and, when receiving an authorization request, check this parameter for 
      compliance with the one in the configuration.
    * ``scope`` --- an optional parameter, the value of which is pre-registered on the TradingView side.
    * ``state`` --- a string value used to maintain state between the request and the callback. Shouldn't be 
      changed on the broker's server and should return to the callback unchanged.
    * ``prompt`` --- the parameter takes the value of ``login`` when requesting authorization and the value of 
      ``none`` when requesting to refresh the token.
    * ``lang`` --- a parameter on demand, transfers the locale of the TradingView site, which the user uses at 
      the time of authorization from the list ``ar``, ``br``, ``cs``, ``de``, ``el``, ``en``, ``es``, ``fa``, 
      ``fr``, ``he``, ``hu``, ``id``, ``in``, ``it``, ``ja``, ``kr``, ``ms``, ``nl``, ``pl``, ``ro``, ``ru``, 
      ``sv``, ``th``, ``tr``, ``uk``, ``vi``, ``zh``.

#. The broker's server gives a page with an authorization form and prompts the user to enter his credentials.
#. The broker's server authenticates and authorizes the user after submitting the form and if successful redirects
   the request to ``redirect_uri`` with parameters that are passed as a fragment.

    * ``access_token`` --- the value of access token which will be used to sign requests to the broker's REST 
      server.
    * ``state`` --- the value of the ``state`` field from the original authorization request. Should return 
      unchanged.
    * ``expires_in`` --- an optional parameter that defines the token lifetime in seconds. If this parameter 
      is omitted, the token will not be refreshed. But it must be borne in mind that this can harm the user's 
      safety.

.. important:: The authorization process takes place on a separate tab. It will close **120 seconds** after opening, 
  even if no access token has been received. You should not require the user to do anything on this tab other than 
  enter credentials. For example, you want to give a user the ability to sign up. Place in the authorization tab a 
  link that opens a new sign up tab.

.. _oauth2-implicit-flow-refresh-token:

Refresh Token
"""""""""""""
When the access token expires, TradingView triggers a token renew. It happens in the following scenario.

* TradingView opens a hidden iframe at the Broker's *Authorization URL*. GET request has the same parameters as during 
  authorization. But the ``prompt`` parameter is set to ``none`` to tell the broker's server to refresh the access token 
  in the background.
* After receiving a request with the ``prompt: none`` parameter, the broker's server redirects the request to the 
  *Redirect URL* with a new access token. The page with the authorization form does not return to the user.

It is possible to leave the ``httpOnly`` cookie on the authorization page when the token is renewed after passing the 
initial authentication. It will allow you to identify the user in the future.

.. warning:: If third-party cookies are disabled in the user's browser, this cookie will not be set to the broker's server
  in the token refresh request. For the :ref:`OAuth2 Implicit flow<oauth2-implicit-flow>`, this problem isn't solved.
  It is preferable to use the :ref:`OAuth2 Code flow<oauth2-code-flow>`, which does not have this issue when updating 
  the token.

.. _oauth2-code-flow:

OAuth2 Code flow
''''''''''''''''
This type of authorization is implemented following :rfc:`6749#section-4.1` and is more secure than the 
:ref:`OAuth2 Implicit flow<oauth2-implicit-flow>`. There is no problem with user identification during token 
refreshing. There is no user authentication issue here, as you can avoid using the ``httpOnly`` cookie when refreshing
the token. The procedures for :ref:`obtaining<oauth2-code-flow-authorization>` an access token and its 
:ref:`renewal<oauth2-implicit-code-refresh-token>` are performed between the TradingView servers and the broker's 
server.

#. The TradingView server sends a POST request for an access token in the ``application / x-www-form-urlencoded`` format

    * ``grant_type`` --- the value always equal to ``authorization_code``.
    * ``code`` --- authorization code obtained from a response to authorization request.
    * ``client_id`` --- unique identifier of the client.
    * ``client_secret`` --- a unique client secret. This parameter has been added for compatibility with the 
      `Auth0 service`_, where it is required.
    * ``redirect_uri`` --- the same *Redirect URI* as in the authorization request.

#. The broker's server sends a response to a request for an access token with the following fields in its body:

    * ``token_type`` --- the value must be ``bearer``.
    * ``access_token`` --- access token that will be used in REST requests to the broker's server.
    * ``expires_in`` --- token lifetime in seconds.
    * ``refresh_token`` --- a token that is exchanged for a new access token before the expiration of the current 
      access token.

Refresh Token
"""""""""""""
When the *access token* expiration is approaching, TradingView automatically starts the token renewal procedure.
A request for a token endpoint is sent to the broker's server with the following parameters:

    * ``grant_type`` --- the value will always be ``refresh_token``.
    * ``refresh_token`` --- a refresh token received in the same request as the current access token.
    * ``client_secret`` --- the value of the client secret provided by the broker.

The response is expected to be the same as for the request to obtain an access token during the initial
authorization.
