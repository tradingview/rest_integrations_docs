Orders
......

The orders statuses can be divided into two groups in our API:

* transitional (``placing``, ``inactive``, ``working``),
* final (``rejected``, ``filled``, ``canceled``).

The status of an order can only change from transitional to final, but not vice versa.

Requests:

* In response to the `/orders`_ request, we expect ALL orders of the current trading session and orders with
  transitional statuses from previous trading sessions.
* In response to the `/ordersHistory`_ request, we expect ALL orders with final statuses from previous trading
  sessions.

Tab Display:

* The Orders tab displays all orders that come in response to the `/orders`_ request.
* The History tab displays all orders that come in response to the `/ordersHistory`_ request and orders from
  `/orders`_ that have the final status. So, orders with final statuses from `/orders`_ are simultaneously displayed
  on both the Orders and the History tabs.

`/orders`_ is used to get current session orders and orders with ``working`` status from the previous sessions. However,
orders, that have recieved final status must should be included in the list till the end of the trading session, or at 
least within 1 minute after changing order status.

`/ordersHistory`_ is used to get order history for the account. It is expected that returned orders would have a final
status. This endpoint is optional. If you don\â€™t support orders history, please set ``supportOrdersHistory: false`` in 
the `/accounts`_ to ``false``. The ``accountId`` parameter is required.
