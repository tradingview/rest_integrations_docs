Orders
......

The orders statuses can be divided into two groups in our API:

* transitional (``placing``, ``inactive``, ``working``),
* final (``rejected``, ``filled``, ``canceled``).

The status of an order can only change from transitional to final, but not vice versa.

Requests:

* In response to the `/orders`_ request, we expect ALL orders of the current trading session and orders with
  transitional statuses from previous trading sessions.
* In response to the `/ordersHistory`_ request, we expect ALL orders with final statuses from previous trading
  sessions.

Tab Display:

* The Orders tab displays all orders that come in response to the `/orders`_ request.
* The History tab displays all orders that come in response to the `/ordersHistory`_ request and orders from
  `/orders`_ that have the final status. So, orders with final statuses from `/orders`_ are simultaneously displayed
  on both the Orders and the History tabs.

`/orders`_ is used to get current session orders and orders with ``working`` status from the previous sessions. Orders
with final statuses should be included in the list till the end of the trading session, or at least within 1 minute
after changing order status.

`/ordersHistory`_ is used to get order history for the account. It is expected that returned orders would have a final
status. This endpoint is optional. If you don\‚Äôt support orders history, please set ``d`` ‚Üí ``config`` ‚Üí 
``supportOrdersHistory`` in the `/accounts`_ to ``false``. The ``accountId`` parameter is required.

.. _section-concepts-brackets:

Brackets
........

By brackets in our UI we mean :ref:`orders<section-concepts-orders>`, the meaning of which is to protect the
:ref:`position<section-concepts-positions>`. Brackets always have the opposite side to the order or position compared
to its parent. The quantity in bracket orders is always equal to the quantity of their parent order.

Brackets can exist either in a pair (:term:`Stop-Loss` and :term:`Take-Profit`) or separately. This means that the
order or position can have only one bracket order (*Stop-Loss* or *Take-Profit*). If a pair exists, bracket orders are
linked by an :term:`OCO` (One-Cancels-the-Other) ‚Äãcondition. It means that when one bracket order is executed, the other
(if any) is automatically cancelled. When one of the brackets is partially executed, the quantity‚Äã in the second bracket
order ‚Äãshould be‚Äã automatically reduced to the remaining ‚Äãquantity of‚Äã the partially executed bracket order ‚Äãon the broker‚Äôs
side‚Äã.

Order Brackets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``supportOrderBrackets`` flag must be set to ``true`` to support order brackets in our UI. In this case, sections
for bracket orders will appear when switching to the order editing mode.

Placing a parent order with brackets
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

When placing an order with brackets through our UI, a POST request is sent to the broker‚Äôs server with ``stopLoss`` and
``takeProfit`` fields or one of them. If the parent order has not been executed immediately, then we expect the parent
order to appear in working status, and one or two (depending on the presence of fields ``stopLoss`` and ``takeProfit``)
in inactive status in the next response to the `/orders`_ request. It is necessary for bracket orders in `/orders`_ to
have a ``parentId`` field, the value of which is the ``id`` of their parent order. The ``parentType`` field of bracket
orders has the ``order`` value.

Modifying parent order with brackets, adding or removing brackets
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

The result of editing the order in our UI is a PUT request to the broker‚Äôs server with new order parameters, including
``stopLoss`` and ``takeProfit`` fields, or one of them. If the user has deleted one of the brackets when changing the
parent order, then it is necessary to send a removed bracket order with ``cancelled`` status in subsequent responses to
the `/orders`_ request. Otherwise, an error will come up: this bracket will ‚Äúhang‚Äù in our user interface in the table
of orders and on the chart. The cancellation of one of the brackets should not lead to the cancellation of another
bracket order and the parent order.

Execution of a parent order with brackets
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Bracket orders are bound to the parent order by the :term:`OSO` (One-Send-Other) condition. When a parent order is
executed, bracket orders are transferred to the ``working`` status. If bracket positions are supported, the ``parentId``
field of the brackets gets the ``id`` value of the position that resulted from the parent order execution, and the
``parentType`` field of the bracket orders changes its value to ``position``.

Canceling a parent order with brackets
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Bracket orders are bound to the parent order by the :term:`OSO` condition. Therefore, when cancelling a parent order,
the brackets must also be cancelled.

Position brackets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Support of position brackets becomes problematic if a broker does not have support for multi positions. To support 
position brackets in our UI, the ``supportPositionBrackets`` flag must be set to ``true``. When the user switches to
edit mode, sections for bracket orders will appear.

Position brackets are supported
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

When one of the bracket orders is executed, the position is reset to zero, and the other bracket order (if any) is
transferred to the ``cancelled`` status. When one of the bracket orders is partially executed, the ‚Äãquantity‚Äã in the
position is reduced by the executed ‚Äãquantity‚Äã. The ‚Äãquantity‚Äã in the other bracket order is given according to the left
‚Äãquantity‚Äã in the partially executed bracket order.

When the user adds brackets to the position, the broker‚Äôs server recieves a PUT request `Modify Position`_, which
contains ``stopLoss`` and ``takeProfit`` fields, or one of them.

Then these bracket orders return with ``working`` status to `/orders`_ with next values:

* ``parentId`` --- the value of the position id,
* ``parentType`` --- the value of the ``position``,
* ``qty`` --- 	the number of units.

When the user closes position, the brackets should be cancelled and sent to `/orders`_ with the ``cancelled`` status.

.. tip::

  #. Open a position using a market order with :term:`Take-Profit` and :term:`Stop-Loss`.
  #. Got a position with brackets (:term:`Take-Profit` and :term:`Stop-Loss`).
  #. Close the position.
  #. Brackets are canceled too.

Position brackets are not supported
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

In this case, after the parent order is executed, the brackets don‚Äôt receive the position id to the `parentId` field
and are no longer linked to the parent order. But the :term:`OSO` brackets binding between each other must be kept on
the broker‚Äôs side. When a position is closed, all orders in the transit statuses (``placing``, ``inactive``,
``working``) are usually canceled.

.. _section-concepts-positions:

üéæ Positions
..........

Positions come in two main types: a :term:`Long position` is formed as a result of buying a symbol, when a 
:term:`Short position` is formed as a result of selling a symbol.

There are no positions for the *Crypto Spots*, but they are present for the *Crypto Derivatives*.
For the *Forex* you can use multidirectional positions. Enable ``supportMultiposition`` parameter in the 
`/accounts`_ endpoint to use it.

You can display *Position* in the :ref:`Account Manager<section-ui-accountmanager>` and on the 
:ref:`Chart<section-ui-chart>`.

Available operations for the postions: *Protect Position*, *Reverse Position*, and `Close Position`_. Use flags in
the `/accounts`_ ‚Üí ``d`` ‚Üí ``config`` to hide its operations.

* Set ``supportPositionBrackets`` to ``false`` to hide *Protect Position*
* Set ``supportReversePosition`` to ``false`` to hide *Reverse Position*

Pip Value
.........

The main purpose of ``pipValue`` is to calculate risks in an :ref:`Order Ticket<section-uielements-orderticket>`  (for
those who use it).

For Forex instruments, the ``pipValue`` size depends on the currency rapidly changing cross rates. You should always
send the actual value. Besides `/instruments`_, pipValue can be sent via `/quotes`_ in the ``buyPipValue`` and
``sellPipValue`` fields. However, if you do not have support for different ``pipValue`` for buy and sell, you should
pass the same values in both fields. 

.. tip::

   Calculating the *Pip Value* is easy. Let's say the account currency is equal to ``CCC``.

   * For the ``XXXCCC`` pair: ``pipValue = pipSize``
   * For the ``CCCXXX`` pair: ``pipValue = 1 / CCCXXX * pipSize``
   * For the ``YYYXXX`` pair: ``pipValue = pipSize * XXXCCC`` or ``pipValue = pipSize / CCCXXX``

   Next, we multiply by ``lotSize`` and ``qty`` for the current order.

* ``minTick`` --- a minimum price movement,
* ``pipSize`` --- size of 1 pip, for Forex symbol usually equals ``minTick * 10``.

For example for EURUSD pair ``minTick = 0.00001`` and ``pipSize = 0,0001``.
